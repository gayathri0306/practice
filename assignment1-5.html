   <p>Six-year-old Mahi lives in Mumbai with her father, grandfather, and her pet dog, Pluto. Mahi suffers from cystic fibrosis, and her single father, Viraj, leaves no stone unturned to dote on her and look after her health, while pursuing his career as a successful fashion photographer. However, whenever Mahi expresses her curiosity about her missing mother, Viraj evades the topic. Eventually, upset when her father refuses to keep his end of the promise to narrate her mother's story, Mahi runs away from home with Pluto.

    Mahi and Pluto cross paths with a lady named Yashna, who saves them from a traffic collision. At Mahi's request, Yashna
     invites Viraj to a restaurant. There, Yashna and Mahi compel Viraj to reveal the story about the little girl's mother, 
     "Varsha". To help Mahi relate to her father's narrative, Yashna suggests the child imagine her as Varsha.</p>

<p>Viraj reluctantly recounts the story of Varsha- ten years ago, Viraj, a struggling photographer, met Varsha in Coonoor and fell in love with her at first sight. Varsha was initially reluctant because her parents' recent divorce caused her to lose faith in love, marriage, and family. However, she gradually reciprocated Viraj's feelings. Varsha's mother disapproved of the relationship due to Viraj's low financial status. Nevertheless, Varsha married Viraj, and the couple had a happy marriage despite the hardships. Eventually, Viraj and his friend, Justin, opened their own studio, becoming commercially successful photographers.

    Three years after their wedding, Viraj revealed his intention to have children. Varsha was initially reluctant, but she changed her mind and agreed to conceive after Viraj's assurance. However, upon learning that Mahi was born with a fatal health condition, Varsha was devastated. She blamed Viraj and regretted ever falling in love with him and conceiving Mahi.</p>
